## Work in progress
### Templates \n
- **Important:** The new features are all highly experimental
- I completly rewrote the way templates/widgtes work
- You now can find two (new) widgets one of them a new input widget
- With the new types of widgtes you can directly add a popupmenu, so you don't have to use a advanced widget for this
- The idea is that the advanced widget is no longer needed, with these kind of widgets
- Fixed some bugs
- You **can now migrate** all older widgtes to new types: Simply go to the **Template Settings** and press **Start**
